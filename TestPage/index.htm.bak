<article><h3>H3--
Open the Registry Editor by hitting Start and typing “regedit.” Press Enter to open Registry Editor, and then give it permission to make changes to your PC.
</p>
<p>
1. Go to >	HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\cmd <br>
2. After gaining control of the cmd key, you’re going to make one small change to one of the values inside it. Right-click the HideBasedOnVelocityId value and select the “Rename” command. Just put an underscore ( _ ) at the beginning of the value’s existing name. All we’re doing here is making the value not register.
</p>
<p>
And that’s all you have to do. The changes take place immediately, so test it by Shift+right clicking a folder and making sure the “Open command window here” command is back. (Note: You can no longer Shift+right click on an empty space within a folder like you use to be able to, you must Shift+right click on an actual folder for this to work.)
